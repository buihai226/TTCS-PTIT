This project aims to develop a web application that supports automatic recognition of vehicle license plates from uploaded images or videos. The system uses a deep learning model (trained by myself) to detect and recognize license plate numbers. This can be applied in real-life scenarios such as entry/exit management in parking lots or garages.
