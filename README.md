# TTCS-PTIT

This project aims to develop a web application that supports automatic recognition of vehicle license plates from uploaded images or videos. The system uses a deep learning model (trained by myself) to detect and recognize license plate numbers. This can be applied in real-life scenarios such as entry/exit management in parking lots or garages.

#Weekly Reports

Date: March 15, 2025

• In the first week, I completed defining system requirements, designing basic interface, setting up backend with Flask, preparing license plate recognition model and collecting sample data for testing.

• In the second week, i am learning about models in Deep Learning(CNN,...), next i am learning about object detection with YOLO(starting from YOLO v1)
